### Job Market Paper: Unofficial Preliminary Release

This working paper is currently hosted on GitHub as a segment of my ongoing Ph.D. thesis, which must be officially submitted to the university's repository before June of 2024. The decision to utilize GitHub, a platform that supports open-access content, is deliberate to prevent potential conflicts with subsequent formal uploads to institutional archives such as Arxiv.
The rationale for making my research publicly accessible at this stage is to address the common practice among recruiters who seek to review the job market paper. I aim to engage with a broader audience and invite constructive dialogue.

I welcome and value your feedback on this research. Should you wish to share your thoughts or are intrigued enough to propose a new research idea, please do not hesitate to email me at carr8824@gmail.com.

I also ask that readers recognize that the content herein has yet to be officially published.
